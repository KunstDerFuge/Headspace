Lovecraftian horror roguelike in space!

Very much a work in progress, this represents my attempt at making a roguelike. The story is hardly solid at this point, but generally, the game will take place on another planet (probably Mars) sometime between the Apollo missions and the dissolution of the USSR. The player will start in a surface outpost that has been damaged by creatures unknown. The player may repair and extend the outpost using raw materials gathered from the surface. The other inhabitants of the outpost may be recruited for construction, or to aid you in spelunking "Mountains of Madness" inspired dungeons and retrieving strange and powerful artifacts.
